Six steps to overcome fear &amp; anxiety for good:

Embrace what you're afraid of.

The more you're exposed to your fears—

The less power they hold over you.

Get comfortable being uncomfortable.

Delay gratification.

You will want to take the short wins.

But if you do, you wont ever make it to the championship.

Enduring short term pain = long term gain.

Do the things regardless.

You can be anxious.

You can be terrified.

You cannot be stagnant.

Action erodes doubt &amp; deposits confidence.

Watch yourself.

What are you afraid of?

What are you avoiding?

Self actualization is impossible without self awareness.

Hold yourself accountable.

If you are the problem—

You too can become the solution.

He who is disciplined is an unstoppable force.
