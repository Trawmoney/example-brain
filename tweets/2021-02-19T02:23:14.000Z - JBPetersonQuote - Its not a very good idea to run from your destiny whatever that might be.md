"It's not a very good idea to run from your destiny.. whatever that might be &amp; you need a destiny; you need a place to aim at because that's what gives your life meaning &amp; you need meaning in your life because life is hard, so you need something to buttress yourself against that" https://t.co/yNMIgoqmUZ
