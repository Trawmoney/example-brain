Reflection I've been doing this week:

Where was I 10 years ago?

• What were my goals?
• How was I spending my time?
• What was most exciting to me?
• What were my biggest struggles?

I'm trying to build my ability to think longer-term, and this reflection is helping.

It's helping me think long term for a few reasons:

• My 10-year-ago problems don't matter at all today

• The problems I have now I would have begged to have had then

• I realize just how long 10 years is, how much can change, and how much progress you can make in that time
