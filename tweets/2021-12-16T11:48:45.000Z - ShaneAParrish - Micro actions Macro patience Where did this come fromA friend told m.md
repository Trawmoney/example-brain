Micro actions. Macro patience.

^ Where did this come from?

A friend told me about @garyvee's saying, "Micro speed. Macro Patience."

Thanks to @JamesClear, I ask myself, what tiny thing  I can do today that sets me up for future success.

Combining the two, you get:

Micro action. Macro Patience.
