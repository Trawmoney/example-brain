3 quick writing tips I wish I knew 2 years ago (that would have saved me hundreds of hours):

Hope these were helpful!

If they were, here are 2 things you can do:

1. Follow me @dickiebush for more short threads on digital writing
2. Hop back up to the top to bookmark it and share them with others: https://t.co/DP8YJF4IPp

1. Write and edit at different times.

I used to think writing and editing were the same thing – but they're different processes.

You need to give it time to breathe – so try this:

• Write something
• Wait 24 hours
• Edit it 
• Send

(Extra tip: edit on a different screen).
