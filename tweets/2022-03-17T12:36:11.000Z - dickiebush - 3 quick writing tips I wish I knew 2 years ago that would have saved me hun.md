3 quick writing tips I wish I knew 2 years ago (that would have saved me hundreds of hours):

1. Write and edit at different times.

I used to think writing and editing were the same thing – but they're different processes.

You need to give it time to breathe – so try this:

• Write something
• Wait 24 hours
• Edit it 
• Send

(Extra tip: edit on a different screen).

2. Read everything you write aloud.

Everything you write looks good on paper.

But to notice:

• Choppy bits
• Wordy jargon
• Run-on sentences

You need to *hear them* rather than *see them*

It takes a little extra time, but this is the easiest writing upgrade you can make.
