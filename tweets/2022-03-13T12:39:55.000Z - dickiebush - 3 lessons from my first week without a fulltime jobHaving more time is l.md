3 lessons from my first week without a full-time job:

Having more time is like having more money.

1) It will magnify your bad habits
2) It won't solve everything you think it will

If you (like me) feel too busy and tell yourself more time is all you need, you have a prioritization problem.

And more time won't solve that.
