3 lessons from my first week without a full-time job:

Having more time is like having more money.

1) It will magnify your bad habits
2) It won't solve everything you think it will

If you (like me) feel too busy and tell yourself more time is all you need, you have a prioritization problem.

And more time won't solve that.

There are 2 pillars of focus:

1) Limiting the number of projects you're working on
2) Going from idea to execution on them quickly

When you work on fewer projects, you make progress on them faster, which makes it easier to keep working on them &amp; on and on – flywheels 101.

Someone I greatly look up to once told me: 

"Work every day until you don't know what day it is – because there's no greater feeling of freedom than when your Wednesdays feel like Saturdays."

... He was right!

Long-form threads are out – too much noise.

3-tweet threads are in!

Going to write 30 of them over the next 30 days.
