it cannot be overstated how *one* person believing in your work can alter the trajectory of your life

but most focus on trying to get thousands of people to sort of like it

or to merely consume it

the algorithm is not your friend 

your friend is your algorithm

this functions as a sort of unlock 

when paired with the internet

that leads to many meaningful connections 

but you have to start with the truth
