“A day in the life” is a misrepresentation. 
Instead: “decade in the life”

When people workout with me, they’re usually like “that’s it?”

They expect intensity, not consistency. 17 years of unfailing, repeated effort, creates outsized results. 

Same for business and marriage. https://t.co/FA4wB32LIi
