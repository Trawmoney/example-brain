Men and women often misunderstand each other when conversations are focused on a specified problem.
Men are often accused of wanting to “fix things” too early on in a discussion. This frustrates men, who like to solve problems and do it efficiently. https://t.co/BJOTKKCJaN

It might be easier for my male readers to understand why this does not work, however, if they could realize and then remember that before a problem can be solved it must be formulated precisely.

Women are often intent on formulating the problem when they are discussing something, and they need to be listened to—even questioned—to help ensure clarity in the formulation.
Then, whatever problem is left, if any, can be helpfully solved.
