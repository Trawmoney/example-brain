Daily routine basically every day since I stopped working full-time:

5-10: Deep work with all distractions blocked

10-12: Exercise 

12-2: Meetings and calls

2-rest of the day: Open for whatever I want (always involves a long walk in the sun listening to books and podcasts)

6 weeks into this new lifestyle.

It feels like I’m waking up every morning and playing a video game, spending all day trying to level up. 

Stress at all time lows, gratitude at all time high, learning faster and more than ever before.

But the best part is I’m tanner than ever.
