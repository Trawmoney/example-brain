Instead of pivoting your startup, jump.

A startup is a theory about something the market wants, but doesn’t yet exist.

If the theory underlying your startup is wrong, a pivot is rarely the correct answer.

To pivot is to turn while keeping one foot in place.

But a correct theory is a good explanation of how the world works.

A good explanation is a self-contained creative leap, and not a compromise between two different explanations. 

It’s hard to vary the details of a good explanation without a complete loss of explanatory power.

In the same manner, a good product is not a compromise between two products.

Good cap tables, founding teams, and customer bases are not compromises between the needs of two different companies.

Pain avoidance leads to pivots when one would be better off shutting down the failed project and launching a fresh one.

If you must pivot your company, take both feet off the ground, and jump.
