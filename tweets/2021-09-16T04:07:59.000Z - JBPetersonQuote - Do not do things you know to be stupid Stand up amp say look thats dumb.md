Do not do things you know to be stupid. Stand up &amp; say "look that's dumb I'm not doing it" and if they ask you why, then you can say "...if I do it, I'm going to get irritated &amp; resentful. And, also, if I do it, it's going to decrease my motivation, so I'm not doing it" https://t.co/9RtXJmD4J0
