### Tweet
'the metaverse' is more about identity liquidity than any specific digital environment 

switching avatars to match tweets
switching community to match mood

adoption measured by the normalization of maintaining a decentralized identity 

don't think fb wins this

liquid identity is much more common on twitter than facebook, and has been since day one, makes sense why nfts went ape shit here and not really anywhere else

same thing w/ discord (interest based social graphs from day 0)

the social graph/philosophy on facebook was quite literally started based on your physical proximity (who goes to school here) 

hard to adapt
