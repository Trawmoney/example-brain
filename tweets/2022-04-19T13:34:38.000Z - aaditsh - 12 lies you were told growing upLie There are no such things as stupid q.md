12 lies you were told growing up:

Lie: There are no such things as stupid questions.

In fact, there are.

At school, you can ask anything.

But in the real world, it's a waste of time.

Don't ask things that are easily google-able. It's a disservice to both parties).

You'll seem lazy, and annoying. https://t.co/t1EcbyDTVw

Lie: Reading will make you smarter.

Being forced to read at a young age will only cause you to hate reading.

When curiosity inspires you to pick up a book, you'll learn how to learn fast, think well, and extract tangible actions. https://t.co/6KixIGlPJc

Lie: "You must work hard to find success in life."

Working hard is overrated. 

Other factors are more important (h/t @naval):

• What you work on
• Who you work with
• The relevance to society https://t.co/fPRqri2Goo

Lie: "It doesn't matter where you are from."

It matters where you come from.

Born in an upper-middle-class family gives you way more opportunities in life than someone born in the slums of India (on average)

The internet minimizes the opportunity gap but it will always exist. https://t.co/ntAu08tcZr

Lie: "You should know what you want to do with your life by the time you graduate college."

Some of the smartest and wealthiest people I know are still figuring it out.

They're trying different and new things everyday.

Everyone's timeline is independent of one another. https://t.co/t74X2Svdfn

Lie: Education ends after university.

"After I finish these 4 years, finally I can stop studying." — every college student ever.

As long as you keep the child-like curiosity in yourself alive, learning will be lifelong. https://t.co/fPkn1KdJH0

Lie: "If it's important, I'll remember."

This is a huge life we tell ourselves when we forget something.

The smaller, forgotten things may have improved your quality of life marginally.

Do yourself a favor: Write stuff down.

It's a lifesaver. https://t.co/lh3Ao5pnqJ

Lie: The end goal is to be famous.

First, I wanted to be rich and famous.

Then I just wanted to be rich. Fame is overrated — too much drama.

Your peace of mind is the highest form of wealth. https://t.co/8otu1PHgm1

Lie: Success is linear.

Our brain tricks us to think that the more effort we put, the more results we get.

But success is not linear...

"Success comes slow and then all at once." — @shl https://t.co/txED8uOOUW

Lie: Mega-successful people made it on their own.

They didn't. You can almost never do it on your own.

The 5 people you surround yourself with, inspirations, co-founders, teachers, location all come into play.

If you want to go far, spend time understanding your environment. https://t.co/ykI6unTv5x

Lie: An exam defines your worth.

School teaches you how to do well on a test. But it doesn't define  success or your self-worth.

I know a lot of people average at school and exceptional at life. 

It's about priorities and self-worth. https://t.co/sLBgokueRU

Lie: If you do more, you are more productive.

Doing more means more context switching. Which equates to more time wasted.

The most productive people do less but better. https://t.co/ORz8E6xmSY
