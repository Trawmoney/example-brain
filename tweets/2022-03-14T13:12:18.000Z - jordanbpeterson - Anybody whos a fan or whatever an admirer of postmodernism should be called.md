Anybody who's a fan or whatever an admirer of postmodernism should be called want to suggest a better capsule summation of the set of doctrines? This is from Wikipedia and it seems about right: https://t.co/GxPEWFlPb7

And this for Marxism: https://t.co/RNqV9ceEvQ

And postmodern neomarxism is the claim that the only truth and grand ethic/narrative is the fact and motivated perpetration of power relations between classes (defined variously: economically, or by race/sex/gender or their "intersection")

And the inevitable and motivated exploitation that results

And the insistence that the resultant inequality of groups must be resisted by all means possible including revolution in the service of the oppressed groups

There is an element of postmodern thought I believe to be true although I think the New England pragmatists following CS Pierce formulated it better: that what fundamentally motivates is what is believed to be true. That's a definition of truth.

The same line of thought runs through Jung's work (and M Eliade, E Neumann, J Campbell). Those thinkers concluded that the hero myth is the foundational narrative.
