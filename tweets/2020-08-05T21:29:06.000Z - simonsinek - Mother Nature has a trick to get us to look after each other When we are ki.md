Mother Nature has a trick to get us to look after each other. When we are kind or generous, when others are kind or generous to us and even when we witness an act of kindness or generosity those warm and fuzzies we feel are thanks to the oxytocin flowing through our bodies. https://t.co/kPh8xYl32m

And here’s the best part, the more oxytocin we have, the more generous we become. 

So do something nice for someone today and you’ll help make them a better person :)
