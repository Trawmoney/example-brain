Used to clock in at 280lbs back in college — I’ve come a long way!

Always loved lifting, but recently picked up running after hating it my entire life. 

Learning that there’s such thing as an “easy run” has been lifechanging 😂 https://t.co/GmoFhM4m5g

A lot of questions on why no alcohol for 12 months and how the first 6 months have gone. 

Putting together a decently long piece on the process so far. 

Feel free to hit reply with any questions I should cover!

Another Sunday long run in the books 🏃‍♂️

7 miles @ 9:20 pace trying to keep my heart rate around 150 https://t.co/7cYF4pcIdm

Another week in the books! 

Very happy with my sleep consistency, all-time low resting heart rate, consistent strength progress, and my longest run ever with 7.5 miles at a 9:30 pace 💯💯 https://t.co/XWbBlyiJ2p
