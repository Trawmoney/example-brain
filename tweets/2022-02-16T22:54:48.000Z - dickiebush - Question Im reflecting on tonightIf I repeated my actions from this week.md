Question Iâ€™m reflecting on tonight:

If I repeated my actions from this week every week for 5 years, where would I end up?

Follow up questions: 

1) Would I be able to do this (i.e. am I living in a sustainable way)

2) Is where I end up where I would want to be? 

3) If yes to #2, how can I double down on these? If no, what needs changing?
