The best habit I've picked up in 2022:

1. Before bed, write down 1 big question or problem I'm trying to solve

2. Wake up and journal on it first thing for 30 minutes

May be confirmation bias, but my subconscious working on the problem overnight leads to huge morning clarity.

A lot of questions if this affects my sleep.

That question stems from believing this would cause overthinking.

But it's the opposite: the act of writing the question and shutting the journal gets me to *stop* thinking about it (consciously).

Give it a try.
