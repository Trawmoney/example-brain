How to earn $1,000,000 this year:

Take imperfect action.

The faster you fail, the faster you learn.

When you learn you earn.

Be consistent &amp; persistent.

Wars are won by strategically crawling through the trenches for months on end without giving up.

If you throw in the towel, you lose.

Master your craft.

Nobody is a black belt on day one.

You have to play the part of the fool.

Fail fast, and learn from your mistakes.

Invest in yourself.

Reduce your spendingâ€”

And redirect it into learning.

You can't achieve your goals without investing in them.

Be authentic.

You don't win by becoming someone else.

You win by becoming more of who you already are.
