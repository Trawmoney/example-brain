"It's okay to be a man".

It's not okay; It's necessary.

You look around cities and see all these buildings go up. These men, they're doing impossible things. They're working on the sewers; they're up on the power lines in the storms and the rain. (1/4)

They work themselves to death (often literally). 

The gratitude for that is sorely lacking, especially among the people who should be most grateful: the social justice bent who are among the most protected and privileged people the world has ever produced. (2/4)

They take everything they have for granted, failing to understand that there's a massive infrastructure of unbelievably hard-working, solidly labouring working-class men breaking themselves in half regularly, making sure that everything that always breaks works. (3/4)

A little gratitude for that is in order. (4/4)
