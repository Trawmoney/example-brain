Schools do a horrible job teaching students to write.

In fact, you should do the *opposite* of everything you learned about writing in school.

So to help you get started, here are 3 real-world writing truths (that will make your English teacher’s skin crawl):

Word count is something to minimize, not maximize.

In school, you had to write a 2000-word essay.

If you wrote 4000 words, you got bonus points.

If you wrote 500 words, you failed.

In the real world, it's the opposite – the market rewards concise, considerate writing.

You, the writer, are completely irrelevant.

Schools force teachers to read your writing – and this makes you believe if you write something, people will read it.

Wrong!

People don't care about you, how long it took you, or why you wrote it – they care what it does for them.

Stop trying to sound smart, cut the fancy words, &amp; write like you talk.

In the real world, you're not impressing anyone when you write this way.

Instead, you should write things at a 3rd-grade level. 

Short words, short sentences, short paragraphs, and no jargon.

3 quick real-world writing lessons they don't teach you in school:

1. Word count is something to minimize, not maximize
2. You, the writer, are completely irrelevant
3. Stop trying to sound smart, cut the fancy words, &amp; write like you talk
