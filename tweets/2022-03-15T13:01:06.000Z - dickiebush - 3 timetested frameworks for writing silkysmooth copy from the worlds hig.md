3 time-tested frameworks for writing silky-smooth copy (from the world's highest-paid copywriter): https://t.co/eoqeBqWWpl

1. Gary was big on writing first thing in the morning. 

So before bed, he would scribble down notes on 4 questions: 

• What's the big idea here?
• What's my product's biggest benefit?
• What's most exciting about this product?
• What emotion am I trying to create.

2. Write something easy, first.

When Gary wasn't feeling it, he would practice copywork.

He had a go-to list of great sales letters he would copy word for word to get warmed up.

I didn't believe this would work at first. 

But it's now my go-to way to get the juices flowing.

3. Write. A LOT. 

Gary says there's no shortcut. And he's right.

The more you write, and the more often you right, the better you will become. 

Because no one has 100 bad pieces of writing. 

They either have 10 and quit, or do it long enough to figure it out.

I've learned more from Gary Halbert than any other writer I've studied. 

His book "The Boron Letters" is a must-read for anyone looking to learn the craft of capturing and keeping attention.
