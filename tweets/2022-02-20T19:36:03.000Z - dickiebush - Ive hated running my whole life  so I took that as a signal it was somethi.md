I’ve hated running my whole life — so I took that as a signal it was something I should start doing.

Goals for this year:

• 6:00 mile 
• 60-minute run @ 8:00/split 

Started the year at a ~6:40 mile and ~9:20 split for an hour. 

2 months into training, I’m getting there! https://t.co/4j0veR64ga

I hated running because your boy used to come in at 6’2, 280lbs. 

My job was to eat and lift weights, will always regret not soaking it in more.

Coming in at 195lbs now so running is much easier. And it’s one of those things you just have to *do* and you make tons of progress. https://t.co/HqXZmCL9SJ
