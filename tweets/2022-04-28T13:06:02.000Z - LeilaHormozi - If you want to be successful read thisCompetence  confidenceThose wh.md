If you want to be successful, read this:

Competence = confidence.

Those who take imperfect action and learn from it, win.

In silence you will find the answer to all questions.

Find what works for you, then double down on it.

Things are hard until they're not.  

Exposure therapy is the key to growth.

Master yourself before you seek to master your environment.

Do not seek an easy life.  

Seek to become so strong that the burdens of life become easy to overcome.

A man who is at peace with himself internally is unbreakable externally.

Ego seeks attention.  Humility seeks growth.

Knowing how to make money &amp; knowing how to keep it are two separate skills. Master both.

Uncommon people consistently do common things.
