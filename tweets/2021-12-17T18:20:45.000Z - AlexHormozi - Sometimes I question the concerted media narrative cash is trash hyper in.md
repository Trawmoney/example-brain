Sometimes I question the concerted media narrative “cash is trash” “hyper inflation” getting everyone to get rid of cash AFAP.

Meanwhile: Elon, Jeff, Zuck, Waltons are all cashing out all time highs. And W.Buffet sitting on $155B.

They appear to be zigging while everyone zags.

Just makes me pause for an extra moment.
