Need help building a product matrix.

Only sellable stuff in existence:
1) Products: digital &amp; physical
2) Services: d &amp; p
3) Access: d &amp; p
4) Risk: d &amp; p
5) Money: d &amp; p

Ps - software is often digital version. Can anyone think of anything else bought/sold that is missing?

Just realized a few: 6) Media 7) Title/Status 8) Businesses (not sure on #8)
