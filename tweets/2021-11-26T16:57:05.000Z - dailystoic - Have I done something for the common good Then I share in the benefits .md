“Have I done something for the common good? Then I share in the benefits.” — Marcus Aurelius

Last year, the Daily Stoic community came together and raised over $100,000 for @FeedingAmerica, providing some 1 million meals. This year we’re trying to go twice as big.

Head over to https://t.co/CtiL8wiQlR to donate. Together we can make a small dent in a big problem.
