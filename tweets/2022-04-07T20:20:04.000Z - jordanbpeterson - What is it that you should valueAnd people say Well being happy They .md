What is it that you should value?

And people say "Well, being happy". They don't mean that.

If you deconstruct what people mean when they say they want to be happy, they really mean they don't want to be miserable. (1/2)

The statement, "I want to be happy", is not an accurate reflection of what you want. (2/2)
