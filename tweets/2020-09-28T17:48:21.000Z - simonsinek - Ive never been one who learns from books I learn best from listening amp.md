I’ve never been one who learns from books, I learn best from listening &amp; asking questions. That’s where all my best ideas come from. When I decided to do a podcast, I wanted to capture some of those conversations. I wanted it to be honest &amp; open…even a little voyeuristic.

I’m looking forward to season two. Until then, season one is now available wherever you like to listen to podcasts. https://t.co/5Uf5JFRMfW
