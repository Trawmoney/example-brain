You don’t owe anyone a reply.

If 500,000 people message you, do you owe them all a reply? 

Embedded within every message is an implied “ask” - the request to reply.

Most people confuse having the time to reply with the obligation to reply. Once you remove the time, u realize the obligation never existed.
