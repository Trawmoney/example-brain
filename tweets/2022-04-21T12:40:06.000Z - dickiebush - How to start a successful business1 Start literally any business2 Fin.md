How to start a successful business:

1. Start literally any business

2. Find 1 part of starting your business that sucks

3. Create a new business to solve that problem

4. Sell your new solution to business owners who have that problem (and are willing to pay for it)

@businessbarista Brainstorm while building is my favorite one.

The best way to find business ideas is to start a business, then find the parts that suck (and go solve those problems). https://t.co/MQuztaIssZ
