A friend is someone you can tell bad news to.

They won’t tell you why you’re an idiot, and they won’t interfere with your suffering. They’ll just listen, and maybe they’ll suffer along with you. And they won’t tell you some worse thing that happened to them. (1/4)

But a friend is also someone you can tell good news to.

They will say, “Wow! In this vale of tears, some good happened to you. Great, man. Wonderful. I hope ten more things like that happen.”

And they’re not envious, jealous and one-upping you. (2/4)

If you’re trying to get your life together, and your friends get in the way, that’s actually really useful for you because you’ve now identified who your real friends aren’t. (3/4)

You may think, “I can’t give them up.” Not only can you, you should and it would be better for them. 

If they’re aiming down, and they want you going down with them, there’s nothing good about what’s happening to them, and there’s certainly nothing good about that for you. (4/4)
