If you want to become a better leader, this is for you:

It's okay to want to do everything yourself.

You've been programed to get satisfaction from your work.

Now you have to program yourself to get satisfaction from other people's work.

It's okay to think you can do things better than everyone else.

We all over estimate our competence.

Yes, you'd have more controlâ€”

But that doesn't mean you'd do a better job.

It's okay to miss feeling like the hero.

Gone are the days of you saving the day.

It's time to give your team the spotlight.

There is nothing wrong with you.

It's expected (and normal) to have these feelings.

You are on the right track.

Keep going.
