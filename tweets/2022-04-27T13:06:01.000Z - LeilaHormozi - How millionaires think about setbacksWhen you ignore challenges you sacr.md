How millionaires think about setbacks:

When you ignore challenges, you sacrifice future success.

The moment you realize setbacks are actually setups, you win.

Overcoming adversity gives you evidence that you can actually do the things.

This creates a positive feedback loop that accelerates your growth.

Perfect conditions don't exist.

Start setting goals and plans around imperfect conditions.

When you expect it to be hard, it becomes far easier to stay in the game.

You have to be willing to suck in order to achieve long term success.

It's not about perfection, it's about learning from your failures.

The faster you expose yourself to failure, the faster you'll experience success.
