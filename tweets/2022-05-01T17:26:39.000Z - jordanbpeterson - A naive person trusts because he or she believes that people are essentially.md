A naive person trusts because he or she believes that people are essentially or even universally trustworthy. But any person who has truly lived has been—or has—betrayed.

Someone with experience knows that people are capable of deception and willing to deceive. (1/4)

That knowledge brings with it an arguably justified pessimism about human nature, personal and otherwise, but it also opens the door to another kind of faith in humanity: one based on courage, rather than naïveté. (2/4)

I will trust you—I will extend my hand to you—despite the risk of betrayal, because it is possible, through trust, to bring out the best in you, and perhaps in me. So, I will accept substantial risk to open the door to cooperation and negotiation. (3/4)

And even if you do betray me, in a not-too unforgivable manner, I will continue to extend my hand. And part of the way I will do that is by telling you what I am feeling. (4/4)
