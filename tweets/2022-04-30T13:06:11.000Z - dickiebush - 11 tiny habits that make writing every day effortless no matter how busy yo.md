11 tiny habits that make writing every day effortless (no matter how busy you are):

I tried (and failed) for years to build a daily writing habit.

So I spent over 1,000 hours studying the writing routines of legendary writers to figure out how they did it.

Now, these 11 little habits have helped me write every day for 504 days in a row.

Let's dive in:

Build a daily walking habit.

95% of my writing happens while I walk.

• Thinking
• Outlining
• Observing
• Brainstorming

The last 5% (when I actually sit down to type) comes later.

Grab a small notebook &amp; pen, then leave your phone behind for 20 minutes.

You'll be amazed.

Capture ideas, everywhere.

To write every day, you need to always have a log of ideas.

So you need to capture them whenever inspiration strikes.

• By your bed (Post-it notes)
• On your walks (Fieldnotes)
• On your phone (Drafts app)
• In the shower (Waterproof whiteboard)
