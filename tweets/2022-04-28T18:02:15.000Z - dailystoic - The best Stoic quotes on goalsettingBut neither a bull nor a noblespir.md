The best Stoic quotes on goal-setting.

“But neither a bull nor a noble-spirited man comes to be what he is all at once…We must undergo a hard winter training and not rush into things for which we haven’t prepared.” — Epictetus

“…The archer must know what he is seeking to hit; then he must aim and control the weapon by his skill. — Seneca

“Our plans miscarry because they have no aim. When a man does not know what harbor he is making for, no wind is the right wind.” — Seneca

“Progress is not achieved by luck or accident, but by working on yourself daily.” —Epictetus

“Lay hold of today’s task, and you will not need to depend so much upon tomorrow’s. While we are postponing, life speeds by.” — Seneca

“Well-being is realized by small steps, but is truly no small thing.” — Zeno

“The first step: Don’t be anxious…The second step: Concentrate on what you have to do. Fix your eyes on it.” — Marcus Aurelius

“Concentrate every minute like a Roman—like a man—on doing what’s in front of you with precise and genuine seriousness, tenderly, willingly, with justice. And on freeing yourself from all other distractions." — Marcus Aurelius
