Underrated copywriting tip:

Just start writing on Twitter. 

• Preset constraints
• No room to ramble
• Competing for attention

The constraints + competition force conciseness + clarity.

And conciseness + clarity are the foundation of effective copy.

The key here is to commit to something *daily*

• 1 tweet
• 1 thread
• 1 Atomic Essay

Doesn't matter – in the beginning, you need to start writing *and publishing* something every day (if you want to learn quickly)

Someone yesterday asked me to describe Ship 30 in 1 line.

I answered: "the constraints, curriculum, and community I wish I had when I first started writing online, all packaged together."

4 days left to join 500+ others already onboard for March!
