1 million email subscribers! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

It's wild to see our community grow to this size. Thank you for being part of it. 

I still have a lot to learn, but I'll do my best to share useful ideas each week. The best is yet to come. https://t.co/EAXJZXLPZY

When I began writing in 2012, I thought I was too late. It seemed like blogs and newsletters had already peaked.

Itâ€™s not too late. Someone is starting the next 1M person email list right now.

The internet is in like the 2nd inning. Get in the game. There is a lot of fun ahead.
