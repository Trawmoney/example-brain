1 million email subscribers! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

It's wild to see our community grow to this size. Thank you for being part of it. 

I still have a lot to learn, but I'll do my best to share useful ideas each week. The best is yet to come. https://t.co/EAXJZXLPZY

When I began writing in 2012, I thought I was too late. It seemed like blogs and newsletters had already peaked.

Itâ€™s not too late. Someone is starting the next 1M person email list right now.

The internet is in like the 2nd inning. Get in the game. There is a lot of fun ahead.

Perspective is important too.

1,000,000 people subscribe to my newsletter.

But there are 328,000,000 people in the US alone. 99.7% of Americans have never heard of it. 

In one sense, itâ€™s huge. In another sense, nobody knows about it.

There is so much room to run.

Anyway, hereâ€™s the link for anyone interested:
