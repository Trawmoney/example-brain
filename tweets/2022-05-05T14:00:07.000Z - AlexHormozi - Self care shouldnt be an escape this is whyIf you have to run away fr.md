"Self care" shouldn't be an escape, this is why:

If you have to run away from your work, you're probably doing shit you hate.

If you need to rest after hanging out with friends, you probably need new friends.

If you run from your spouse, you probably need to confront the unpleasant conversations.

Stop tolerating shit you hate.

When you build a life for YOU, you'll never need to escape from it.

That is real self-care no glass of wine and lazy Sunday can give you.
