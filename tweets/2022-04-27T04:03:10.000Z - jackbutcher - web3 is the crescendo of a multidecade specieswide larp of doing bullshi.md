"web3" is the crescendo of a multi-decade species-wide larp of doing bullshit jobs

now you can larp in plain sight

to be clear i am not shitting on web3, whatever it may be

it is the more honest version of playing a character

we have constructed some very impressive (but largely boring) larps as a species 

not any more
