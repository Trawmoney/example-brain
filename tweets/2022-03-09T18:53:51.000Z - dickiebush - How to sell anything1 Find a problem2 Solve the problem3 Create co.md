How to sell anything:

1. Find a problem

2. Solve the problem

3. Create content to point out the problem to people who have it

4. Create content to hype up the benefits of solving the problem

5. Position your product as the obvious solution

Don't overcomplicate it.

How to not sell anything:

1. Assume something's a problem (instead of having proof)

2. Create a solution based on that assumption (which the market won't need)

3. Create content hyping up the features of your product &amp; what it does (instead of what it can do for your customer)
