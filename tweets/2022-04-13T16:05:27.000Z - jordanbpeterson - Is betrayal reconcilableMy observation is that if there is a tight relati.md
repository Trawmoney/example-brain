Is betrayal reconcilable?

My observation is that if there is a tight relationship and one party is betrayed by the other (falling in love with another person), it's almost always irreconcilable. (1/5)

I've helped people try and struggle through that on both sides of the issue (the person betrayed and the person who did the betrayal).

I have seen people grow up and not do it again. And this was in situations where their partner didn't know. (2/5)

In a couple of those situations, it seemed that it might even be described as a necessary experience for the person who did it. It helped them develop.

I am NOT justifying that behaviour, but life is complicated. (3/5)

However, I think society works better, all things considered, when you make a promise and you stick to it.

One of the things I learned from reading Jung was that there are things in a marriage that you can't have unless you're all in. I believe that. (4/5)

If there's a back door open, to begin with, or a back door opens, then I think there's something about the relationship that's lacking, at least, and I think you pay a huge price for that. (5/5)
