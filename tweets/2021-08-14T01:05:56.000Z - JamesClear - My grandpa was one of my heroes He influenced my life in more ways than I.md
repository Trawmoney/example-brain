My grandpa was one of my heroes. 

He influenced my life in more ways than I can count.

He passed away almost 15 years years ago, but today we found this page in one of his old notebooks.

He titled it the “Positive Thinking Principle”

Transcribed below… https://t.co/xcPBAhLSKb

The “Positive Thinking Principle”

The way you think is the way you act. 

The way you act is the way you are.

Always repeat (always): Assume the result accomplished and it will be accomplished.

Make today count — positive thinking.

Know what you want.

Hang in there long enough and tough enough by intense desire, belief, prayer, and always assume the result accomplished. (Make today count.)

No “ifs”   i.e. if this or if that, but…

“How” can I be better?
“How” can it be done? 
“How” can I get going?
“How” can I accomplish?

This is the positive thinking principle.

/end

We think this note is at least 30 years old. Possibly much older. 

I’d never seen it until today, but I was lucky to have a grandpa who taught me lessons like these every day. His influence on my work is deep and lasting.

I hope you find it useful too.
