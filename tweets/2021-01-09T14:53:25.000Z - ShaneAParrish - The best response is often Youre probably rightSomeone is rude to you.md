The best response is often "You're probably right."

Someone is rude to you: You're probably right. 
Someone disagrees with you: You're probably right.

Not only does this response avoid or stop the fight, but it saves you a time and energy.

Footnote: I first came across this idea from R. B. Sparkman, who wrote "retaliation begets more retaliation," (really the mental model of reciprocity in action.)

Sparkman said: "The best response you can make to rude remarks is "You're probably right."
