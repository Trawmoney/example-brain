3 lenses I use to guide my decisions and actions:

1. What would the person I'm trying to become do in this situation? 

There isn't a "moment" where you "become" a certain type of person. 

The only way to become that type of person is to start acting like them, today.

2. What would the person I'm trying to avoid becoming do in this situation?

This is a simple inversion of the 1st question. 

And sometimes it works better – because avoiding is easier than doing. 

I think about what this average person would do, then simply do the opposite.

3. Will I regret doing this (or not doing this)

– In 80 years?

This is for big life decisions and helps me think long-term.

– At the end of the day today?

This is for daily actions and helps me:

1) Do the things I never regret doing
2) Avoid the things I always regret doing
