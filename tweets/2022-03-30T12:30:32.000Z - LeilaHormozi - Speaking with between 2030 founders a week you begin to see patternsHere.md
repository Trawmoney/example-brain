Speaking with between 20-30 founders a week you begin to see patterns.

Here are the Top 3 Reasons they’re stuck between 1-3M AR…

1.) Lack of focus
2.) Wrong cofounder
3.) Zero customer segmentation 

Continued below 👇🏻

Lack of Focus:

At the first sign of material success, they expand into various other product lines, brands or businesses entirely before stabilizing the original revenue stream..

The outcome is 2-5 mediocre product lines rather than 1 that is stable &amp; growing.

Fix: Consolidate

Wrong Co-Founder(s):

Typically the founder..

Doesn’t believe talent will come for less than a large % of business

Doesn’t know what talent looks like (person not good)

Gives away too much early - none left for real talent later 

Fix: Seller finance buying out the cofounder.

Zero Customer Segmentation:

Founder has 1 product but lacks the discipline to sell to only the ideal archetype for that product. 

Ends up with low upsells, retention &amp; WOM

Fix: Segment for best customer for 1st product, use other customer archetypes to design backend &amp; upsell
