The reason wealth inequality exists isn’t because of greed, it’s because of math. 
If everyone restarted at zero, in one generation there would be some with more and others with less.
Compound that “more” by 10% annually for 3 generations…and it becomes insurmountable.

Ex: 
Median wealth in US= ~$121,000
Top 1% wealth= ~$11,000,000

Let’s assume they’re both as good with their money (they’re not). 

In the next year, the gap grows wider by $1.1M, not because of evil. But because compounding works. 

In time a little advantage becomes a big one.
