A thread on accountability...

You have to be the most potent source of accountability in your company.

While responsibility and accountability seem interchangeable, accountability is the act of holding someone to their responsibility.

For every business and teammate metric that you measure there is an opportunity to evaluate those on a spectrum.

Here’s the thing, metrics are binary. People? That’s a different story. Their performance is constantly fluctuating. And this is where CEOs fall short. This is a byproduct of your beliefs.

Examples:

“I shouldn’t have to babysit them.”

“We’re all adults here - they should know if they’re doing their job.”

“They’re more experienced (or older). Why should I tell them what to do?”

“They aren't high performers like us.”

Before you take on the belief thinking you’re an asshole boss who is micromanaging, consider that instead you’re making them aware of their blindspots -they simply don’t know. Verbalize what you see and reinforce it with repetition.

The bottom line: Instead of having conversations with yourself - the necessary conversations with those you're accountable for and watch your business get “unstuck”
