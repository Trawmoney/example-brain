In 2016 I had achieved a level of success that many people would be happy to end with. I had a thriving fitness business, I was in bikini competitions, and it felt like I had all that I wanted.

Success in fitness + Success in business = great life. Right?

Wrong. I hated it.👇🏻

I realized this gym life didn’t align with my values. It was more about vanity than helping people. That and I was making a lot of money but literally had no time.  I couldn’t spend it. Lastly, I couldn’t focus on what I was passionate about; transforming lives.
