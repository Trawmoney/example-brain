In 2016 I had achieved a level of success that many people would be happy to end with. I had a thriving fitness business, I was in bikini competitions, and it felt like I had all that I wanted.

Success in fitness + Success in business = great life. Right?

Wrong. I hated it.👇🏻

I realized this gym life didn’t align with my values. It was more about vanity than helping people. That and I was making a lot of money but literally had no time.  I couldn’t spend it. Lastly, I couldn’t focus on what I was passionate about; transforming lives.

I was a one-man show who had to focus on all the business things instead of working on what I was inherently good at which was helping people. One day before going into the gym I caught myself crying and realized this wasn’t new. I had been crying for 2 months.

We stay too long out of stubbornness and fear. And when that doesn’t align with our values we are dead inside (and maybe crying in the car). Don’t make decisions off your feelings, use facts. 

Here’s what I did.

I mapped it outweighing Opportunity Costs (OC) vs Sunk Costs (SC). Quick side note– at the time, I had recently met @AlexHormozi  who wanted to go into business together for @GymLaunch  

My biz: (OC) 200K/yr (SC) 3 years and about 10K total.  Cool - I could make 190K/yr

Gym Launch (SC) $0  (OC) of Gym Launch - Alex figured 3MM.  Take out my (OC) of my biz and I’m looking at 2.8MM. It worked out pretty well when we were sitting at 100MM 5 years later. The “leap” wasn’t a leap because I used math and not my gut.

If you hate where you’re at, look at Sunk and Opportunity Costs and let math and facts help you out of it.
