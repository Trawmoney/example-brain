We learn what things mean because people tell us the meaning (first) or we ascribe it ourselves.

The process of unlearning is swapping the meaning we were given with the meaning we choose.

Ex: Wearing a suit can mean you’re a crook or you’re successful depending on how you define it.

But at the end of the day, it’s just cloth we wear on our body. The rest os the story we create to interpret meaning.
