The danger of lying too much.

Lying is very powerful because you can manipulate the world with your language. And you can get what you want lots of times; or escape from things you don't want.

So, why not lie all the time? (1/4)

Well, there are many reasons, but one of them is that you can't trust yourself if you lie.

And there are going to be times in your life when you have no one to turn to except you. (2/4)

So, if you've stuffed yourself full of lies, you're going to be in a crisis one day, and you're going to have to make a decision, and you're going to decide wrong, and you're going to be in real trouble. (3/4)

You won't have the clarity of mind necessary to make the proper judgment because you have filled your imagination and perception with rubbish. (4/4)
