A mentor once told me… 

“If you want to buy a boat but insist on knowing how much gas will cost, you’re not ready for the boat.”

Morale of the story: If you want to buy something truly nonsensical and for pure enjoyment, make sure you have enough F U money that it doesn’t take a second of attention from you. 

Attention is your most valuable asset
