Expensive stuff means more when we’re poor.

And so we work to buy more.

But as we make more, the expensive stuff becomes cheaper and common.

So in an attempt to get more, we remove what made it magical to begin with—scarcity &amp; relative cost. 

Enjoy stuff while it’s special.

…because it won’t last
