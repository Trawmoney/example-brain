Stop this “self care” nonsense.

Just do shit you like.
Cut people who suck.

And you won’t have to “recover” from your life. 

Instead, your life itself, rather than your escape from it, becomes your “self care.”

Reminder: Weekends are not even 100 years old. Our ancestors survived just fine. So will you.

And they didn’t even know the term “self care” existed.

But, we should grateful that society got so soft. It makes the game easy for anyone who has any sack at all.
