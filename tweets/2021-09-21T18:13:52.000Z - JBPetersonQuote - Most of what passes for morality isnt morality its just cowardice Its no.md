Most of what passes for morality isn't morality it's just cowardice. It's not that I'm a good person &amp; I don't hurt you, it's that I'm afraid to hurt you &amp;..I don't want to admit that I'm afraid..[so] I say I'm moral..I can mask my essential fear &amp;cowardice in a guise of morality https://t.co/4SGltxxH0s
