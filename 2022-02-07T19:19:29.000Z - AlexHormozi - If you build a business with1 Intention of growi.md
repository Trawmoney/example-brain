If you build a business with:
1) Intention of growing it forever
2) The belief that it will be hard. 

You should choose your business partners like your marital partners. 

Very carefully with the assumption that you’ll be with this person for life.

And be attracted to them…(kidding!)
Unless you’re married - in which case - makes the game both harder and easier at the same time.
