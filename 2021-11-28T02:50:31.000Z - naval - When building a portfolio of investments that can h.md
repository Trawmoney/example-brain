When building a portfolio of investments that can have non-linear outcomes, never sell early.

You may be right most of the time, but the one time you’re wrong will cost you most of the returns.

Valid reasons for selling:

• You’ve completely lost faith in the project.

• You can redeploy into a better investment (after accounting for headwinds from tax).

• It accounts for too much of your net worth.

• You have a worthwhile personal expenditure to make.
