“Expert” is proclaimed often, rarely achieved.

Def: having a comprehensive and authoritative knowledge of or skill set in a particular area

Latin: “experiri” which means TRY. Same root as “experience.”

Ie—&gt;a person wise through experience.

Don’t claim it unless you have it.

If you expand the time gap between when you start doing something and when you claim you’re good at it, all parties are better served.
