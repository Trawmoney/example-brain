Unpopular opinion:
Willpower doesn't exist.

Willpower is doing something you don't want to do.
But humans always do what they want to do.

If you 'force yourself' to go to the gym, then you want to go to the gym (even though you don't enjoy it).

Maybe I'm missing something?

Just like when a thief points a gun at you and asks for your wallet.

You don't enjoy giving him your wallet.

But you want to do it (or you don't want to get shot), so you do it.

No willpower needed, even though you're doing something you don't enjoy.
