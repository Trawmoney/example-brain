You cannot both desire a mental state and experience it at the same time.

When you admit you want it, 
you admit you dont have it.

This gives merit to the old adage 
“be careful what you wish for”

Not because you might experience it, 
but because by wishing for it, you wont.

We can only experience a state by being present in it. This means we can’t be thinking about it. Which means we must give up our illusion of control over its occurrence. And by extension, only achieve it by not trying to.
